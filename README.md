# Time

A simple application used for calculating and saving times. View time [here](https://time.garthtoland.com).

## Development

Run `npm run devWeb` to start the front-end server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
Run `npm run devServer` to start the back-end server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. If you run both commands at the same time you will have the full functionality of the application.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Unit tests
